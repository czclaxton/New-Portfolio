# Portfolio-Template
A place where we collaborate to make a portfolio template.

### How to contribute
All feature should be worked on in a feature branch. Be clean and precise with your pull requests -- don't mix navigation changes into the portfolio grid branch, for example.

### Tools, frameworks, and libraries used
This template is built with React, Redux, and Styled Components.
